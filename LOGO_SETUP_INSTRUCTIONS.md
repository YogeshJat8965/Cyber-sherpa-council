# Logo Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Custom Logo

1. **Copy your logo file** `Gemini_Generated_Image_esqpspesqpspesqp.png` to this location:
   ```
   /home/yogesh/Desktop/cisoAilifebot/project/public/images/Gemini_Generated_Image_esqpspesqpspesqp.png
   ```

2. **That's it!** The navigation component has already been updated to use your logo.

## What I've Changed:

- ✅ Updated Navigation component to use your PNG logo
- ✅ Added error handling (fallback to Shield icon if image fails)
- ✅ Set proper image dimensions (40x40px) with object-contain
- ✅ Added proper alt text for accessibility
- ✅ Created public/images directory for your logo

## File Structure:
```
project/
├── public/
│   └── images/
│       └── Gemini_Generated_Image_esqpspesqpspesqp.png  <- Place your logo here
└── src/
    └── components/
        └── Navigation.tsx  <- Already updated
```

## Logo Specifications:
- **Size**: 40x40 pixels (will scale properly)
- **Format**: PNG (supports transparency)
- **Position**: Left side of navigation bar
- **Fallback**: Shield icon if image fails to load

After copying your logo file to the correct location, refresh your browser to see the new logo in action!
